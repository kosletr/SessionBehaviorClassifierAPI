# Social Network - Datasets

This dataset was created for the scope of my Bachelor Thesis in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki during the academic year 2019-2020. The main purpose of this dataset is to enable the creation of a machine learning model that is able to detect user's malicious web sessions provided certain features.

# Tools
For the malicious instances (Abnormal) we used:

- [THC-Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) - for the Brute-Force (Dictionary) attacks.
- [Hulk](https://github.com/grafov/hulk) - for Denial of Service attacks.
- [LOIC](https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC) - for Denial of Service attacks.
- [OWASP ZAP](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) - for vulnerability testing in general.

while for the benign instances (Normal) we used:

- A [Social-Network](https://github.com/misa-j/social-network) MERN stack website  (MongoDB-ExpressJS-ReactJS-NodeJS).
- Abnormal-Behavior-Detection-System (seham - npm package and session-behavior-classifier API).

# Data

## Malicious Instances

| Category            | Number of Instances |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Dictionary Attacks  |        96           |
| DoS Attacks         |        38           |
| Aggresive Vuln Scan |        71           |

## Total Instances

| Category            | Number of Instances |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
|  Abnormal           |       205           |
|  Normal             |       800           |


## Export Features from MongoDB

To export features from a MongoDB Database - Collection just open the `exportFeatures.py` file using a text editor of your choice and add your settings to the `Parameters` section:

| Parameter           | Description         |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| `dbName`            | The name of the database to get the data from. |
| `collectionName`    | The name of the collection in the specified database. |
| `exportFilename`    | The name of the file to save the dataset. |
| `mongoUri`          | The URI that identifies the MongoDB Database. |

Then run the script using python:

```markdown
python exportfeatures.py
```

The script produces two .csv files. One for the numeric features and another one for the reqBodies string feature in the appropriate form for training.
Cut the string-dataset file and paste it in the `malicious-payload-text-classifier` directory. Merge it with the provided dataset before training.
