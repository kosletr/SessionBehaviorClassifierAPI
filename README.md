# Abnormal-Behavior-Detection-System

# Description

This collection of scripts was created for the scope of my Bachelor Thesis in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki during the academic year 2019-2020. 

Specifically, it contains:

- `Session Behavior Classifier API` which is an API written in Python's Flask framework, responsible for assigning behavior labels in user's web sessions using machine learning techniques.
- `Malicious Payload Text Classifier` which is a text classification model written using python's library Keras (backend: tensorflow), responsible for classifying user's request-bodies as either an attack-payload or normal text.
- `Abnormal Behavior Feature Classifier` which is a binary classification model (or anomaly detection model) written using python's sklearn and Keras libraries, responsible for classifying other http features as either abnormal or normal.
- `Datasets` which contains the data collected from a deployed social-network website for the purpose of evaluating the ability of the implemented system.

## Prerequisites

- Node JS - as a Backend Service
- Express JS - REST API (express - node package)
- MongoDB - Database (mongoose - node package)
- Seham - node package
- Python 3 - Classification Models, API, etc. (Tested on Python 3.6)

More information about the requirements, installation process and execution details can be found in the corresponding folder. 

# Quick Start

The order in which each component should be used is the following:

- Install and configure `seham` on your website.
- Disable the use of the classification models in `Session Behavior Classifier API` in order to collect user's web traffic data.
- Deploy the `Session Behavior Classifier API`.
- Create two datasets (numeric + text features) using `exportFeatures.py` script located in the `datasets` folder and add labels to the `behavior` attribute.
- Train the `Abnormal Behavior Feature Classifier` using the numeric dataset.
- Train the `Malicious Payload Text Classifier` using the provided dataset, after merging it with the extracted string dataset.
- Copy the `model.joblib` (or `model.h5`) and the `textModel.h5` trained models to the `session-behavior-classifier-api\api` directory.
- Enable the use of the classification models in `Session Behavior Classifier API` to start using the system.

The provided `model.joblib` file was created based on `misa-j`'s `social-network` website for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation of the system's efficiency.
