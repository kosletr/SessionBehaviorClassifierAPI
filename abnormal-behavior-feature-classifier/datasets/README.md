# Social Network - Datasets

This dataset was created for the scope of my Bachelor Thesis in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki during the academic year 2019-2020. The main purpose of this dataset is to enable the creation of a machine learning model that is able to detect user's malicious web sessions provided certain features.

# Tools
For the malicious instances (Abnormal) we used:

- [THC-Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) - for the Brute-Force (Dictionary) attacks.
- [Hulk](https://github.com/grafov/hulk) - for Denial of Service attacks.
- [LOIC](https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC) - for Denial of Service attacks.
- [OWASP ZAP](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) - for vulnerability testing in general.

while for the benign instances (Normal) we used:

- A [Social-Network](https://github.com/misa-j/social-network) MERN stack website  (MongoDB-ExpressJS-ReactJS-NodeJS).
- Abnormal-Behavior-Detection-System (seham - npm package and session-behavior-classifier API).
