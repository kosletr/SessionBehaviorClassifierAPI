# Malicious Payload Text Classifier


# Motivation

The following scripts were created for the scope of my Bachelor Thesis in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki during the academic year 2019-2020. 

The purpose of this collection of scripts is to provide a character-level text-classifier to classify text as an attack payload [SQL Injection, XSS, Path Traversal, Command Injection] or not.

In a nutshell the scripts provided do the following:

- Import the provided dataset (Morzeux's HttpParamsDataset + Website Strings dataset -- Check the `datasets` README file).
- Edit/Keep useful information from the dataset.
- Split data to training (60%), validation (20%) and testing (20%) sets and export them into three separate files.
- Apply preprocessing to each set. Assign each carachter of the data to an integer and encode each label to One-Hot-Encoding.
- Train a character-level convolutional neural network on the training set, while using the validation test to avoid overfitting.
- Test the model and evaluate its efficiency on the training set for given metrics.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 (tested for Python 3.6)

# Usage

Install requirements

```markdown
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to train the model just run:

```markdown
python textClassifierTrain.py
```

## Parameters
You can specify the following parameters:

| Name             | Default           | 
| ---------------- | ----------------  |
| `optimizer`      |       adam        | 
| `batch_size `    |       128         | 
| `epochs`         |        7          |
| `metrics`        | Precision, Recall |
